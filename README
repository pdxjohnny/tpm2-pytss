This is some manually written cython that calls into ESAPI
and gets a random value.

BUILD:
python setup.py build_ext --inplace

RUN:
./test.py

While this is verbose, you have a ton of control over the API and it's easy to kick out Pythonic things.
GetRandom somehow magically worked as a python array and I have no idea why, but i'll take it.
